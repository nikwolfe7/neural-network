Ported C version into Java to avoid compilation issues, improve extensibility, 
and encourage more general use. This is intended to be a literal copy of the C 
version to the extent possible given the language differences.

This code has been placed in the public domain by its author.  As a matter
of simple courtesy, any use of this code should aknowledge its author.
The author would like to hear of any attempts to use this code, successful
or not.

This program implements the Cascade-Correlation [2], Recurrent 
Cascade-Correlation [3], Cascade-2 [unpublished] and the Recurrent 
Cascade-2 [unpublished] architectures.  All weight updates make use of
the Quickprop [1] weight update algorithm.  Enjoy!
