# To run:

# Keep directory structure as is. To run our experiments on each toy dataset, simply run the associated JAR file:

java -jar xor.jar
java -jar cosine.jar
java -jar circle.jar
java -jar diamond.jar
java -jar rshape.jar
java -jar drshape.jar

# Or, just make this file executable and run this. 
# It will take a long time to finish, but the output 
# goes through the examples we discuss in the slides 
# in our presentation and in the report.
#
# For each trained network, it will first print the ground
# truth for the network in terms of the optimial ordering for each
# neuron to be turned off. Then it will go through the first order
# approximation, and then the second order approximation. 
#
# The files generated are the comparison of the rankings assigned to the 
# individual neurons, then the ground truth ordering, the output values for 
# every 10th neuron after adjusting the gain through a range of values, and
# then the first and second order approximations. The file names are
# descriptive. 
#
# Enjoy!
#
# P.S. The dnn-0.9.9.jar file is an archive of the code. If you want to use it! :-)
